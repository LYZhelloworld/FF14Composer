# FF14Composer
A tool for practising music playing in FF14

# How to Use
Download and run `ff14composer.py`. You should see a small black window.

Key configurations (you cannot change it in current version without changing the source code):
* ZXCVBNM = CDEFGAB
* SD GHJ = C# D# F# G# A#
* Comma = C +1 octave (C+ for short)
* Shift = +1 octave
* Ctrl = -1 octave
(Please note that Ctrl+, does not work due to some unknown bug.)

# Recording
Now you can record the notes with the program. The notes will be shown in the command line interface.

Every time you press the Enter key, the recorded notes will be displayed.

Press Backspace to erase ALL recorded notes (but not including the ones on the CLI).
